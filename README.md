Alice 2.0 is an educational 3D modelling software developed by Carnegie Mellon University.
I have produced some services, apps and content for this.

## Usage

1. Download the latest version of [Alice 2.x](https://www.alice.org/get-alice/alice-2/).
2. Find the item you want to play or use:

- [Worlds](worlds) - Download an _\*.a2w_ file; Launch Alice; open from inside; click _Play_.
- [Objects](objects) - Download an _\*.a2c_ file; Launch Alice; create or load a world; click _File_ -> _Import_.
- [Textures](textures) - Download an image file; Launch Alice; create or load a world; click _File_ -> _Import_.
- [Audio](audio) - Download an audio file; Launch Alice; create or load a world; click _File_ -> _Import_.
- [Utilities](utilities) - Choose your utility and follow instructions in its folder.

## Important

- **All content is for Alice 2.x, not Alice 3.x**.
- **Different minor versions of Alice 2 may function differently with each world and item.**
- **This project's content is old, from 2015 and earlier, some of it may be coded poorly or not operate as expected anymore.**
